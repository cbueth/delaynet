# Demos

To get a better idea how to use `delaynet` in your code and research,
see the following notebooks which integrate the package's features.

```{admonition} TBD
:class: warning

Demos are currently beoing prepared and will be available shortly.

- Demo 1: Synthetic connectivity and optimal lag - based on the paper's methods
  example, this demo shows how to:
    - compare several connectivity measures on synthetic delayed-causal data.
- Demo 2–3: Coming soon.
