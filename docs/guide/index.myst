# Reference Guide

Welcome to the `delaynet` Reference Guide.
This guide provides comprehensive documentation for the `delaynet` package, a Python library for **reconstructing delay functional networks** from time series data.
Reconstruction can be performed using various building blocks and connectivities,
e.g. by detecting causality relationships with granger causality tests or transfer entropy.

## Sections

`delaynet` offers a suite of tools for analyzing time series data and reconstructing delay networks from time series.
The package is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to apply various methods for preprocessing, normalisation, and connectivity analysis.

## What You'll Find in This Guide

- **[Preparation](00_preparation)**: Learn what data format to prepare, or how to generate synthetic data for testing and experimentation, including random data and fMRI time series.

- **[Preprocessing](10_preprocess)**: Discover methods for preparing time series data for analysis, including symbolization techniques for converting continuous time series to discrete form.

- **[Normalisation Methods](20_norm)**: Explore various normalisation techniques to standardize time series data, remove trends, and make different time series comparable.

- **[Connectivity Measures](30_connectivity)**: Learn about the different connectivity measures available in `delaynet`, including Granger Causality, Linear Correlation, Mutual Information, and more.

- **[Network Reconstruction](40_network_reconstruction)**: Understand how to infer the structure of a network from time series data (work in progress).

- **[Network Pruning](41_network_pruning)**: Learn about methods for simplifying complex networks by removing weak or insignificant connections (work in progress).

- **[Topological Analysis](42_topological_analysis)**: Discover techniques for analyzing the structural properties of networks (work in progress).

- **[Evaluation](50_evaluation)**: Find out how to evaluate the performance of network reconstruction methods.
